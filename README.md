This is the basic setup for the DSPolitical Take Home Project.

To setup your local instance, run `./setup.sh`. This command will build the local docker images, install php and npm dependencies, and start the containers.

After that, you should be able to navigate to localhost:3000 and see changes you make live. The API will be available at localhost:8000.
